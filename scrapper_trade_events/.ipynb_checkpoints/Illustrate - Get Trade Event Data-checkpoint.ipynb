    "# Purpose\n",
    "Knowledge of trade event data in a specific market can be very helpful. Uses include:\n",
    "1. Demand and capacity planning. Certain industries (eg: travel, hospitality, F&B) would benefit from knowing when demand for their services would peak, and alter their capacity and pricing accordingly.\n",
    "2. Comparison against same event in the past. It is troublesome to search the internet for the exact dates of an biennial-recurring event (eg: Singapore Air Show). Looking up the exacts dates in a searchable database would be more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- If ever need to update records, the combined key of \"title + dt_from\" should be unique.\n",
